# CalculatorApp
A beginner C# Windows Forms calculator demonstrating basic arithmetic operations, event-driven programming, and UI design.
**C# Windows Forms Project (.NET 10 Preview)**

## Overview
A beginner C# WinForms calculator demonstrating basic arithmetic operations, event-driven programming, and UI design.  
This project is part of my personal learning portfolio, showcasing practical coding skills in desktop applications.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Standard calculator controls: digits 0–9, decimal point, clear (C), clear entry (CE), backspace, sign toggle, equals
- Immediate result display while entering expressions
- Dark-themed UI

## Skills Demonstrated
- C# programming
- Windows Forms development
- Object-oriented design (OOP)
- Event-driven programming

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/CalculatorApp.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project (Start Debugging or Start Without Debugging)

> Note: `bin` and `obj` folders are excluded from the repository. Build locally to generate executable files.

## Future Improvements
- Improve input validation and handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero, large numbers)
- Refactor code for clarity and maintainability
- Enhance UI and user experience

## Feedback
Feedback and suggestions are welcome, especially on code structure, error handling, and UI improvements.
